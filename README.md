## What is a recommendation system?

A recommendation engine is a system that suggests products, services, information to users based on analysis of data. 
Notwithstanding, the recommendation can derive from a variety of factors such as the history of the user and the behaviour of similar users.

## Our Idea To Do the Task in More Efficient Way -

We have build a robust recommender system for Amazon Products. 
We have used various Machine Learning algorithms and tested them. We have used Electronics dataset. 
This dataset has product id, which is a unique identifier for all products on amazon.com. It also contains the star rating given by each user identified by the user id.

## Algorithms To Rescue

- [ ] Popularity based
- [ ] Collaborative filtering 
- [ ] Hybrid Recommendation System


2. Collaborative filtering
   - Collaborative filtering using Singular value decomposition
    - Collaborative filtering using KNN With means (user-user similarity)
     - Collaborative filtering using KNN With means (item-item similarity)
